# Introduction
The research's aim is to develop an e-nose system to determine fruit ripeness, crucial for assessing shelf life. Different fruit aromas are linked to their ripeness levels. MATLAB is used for data collection, 
focusing on bananas, mangoes, and tomatoes at unripe, ripe, and overripe stages. MATLAB's user-friendly add-on assists in building classification models, employing machine learning algorithms like decision 
trees and support vector machines.

# Methodology
The stages taken in this research can be summarized into 4 categories:
- Data Acquisition
- Data preparation
- Machine Learning
- Evaluation
